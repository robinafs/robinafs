This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval.

The repo includes sample data so it's ready to try end to end. In this sample application we use a fictitious company called Contoso Electronics, and the experience allows its employees to ask questions about the benefits, internal policies, as well as job descriptions and roles.

## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](#switching-from-an-azure-openai-endpoint-to-an-openai-instance).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](#existing-resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

## Azure deployment

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT and Ada models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Form Recognizer: SO (Standard) tier using pre-built layout. Pricing per document page, sample documents have 261 pages total. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/form-recognizer/)
- Azure Cognitive Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour.[Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for Azure App Service and Form Recognizer by changing the parameters file under the `infra` folder. There are some limits to consider; for example, the free Form Recognizer resource only analyzes the first 2 pages of each document. You can also reduce costs associated with the Form Recognizer by reducing the number of documents in the `data` folder, or by removing the postprovision hook in `azure.yaml` that runs the `prepdocs.py` script.

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

You have a few options for setting up this project.
The easiest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup all the tools for you,
but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment) if desired.

#### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=599293758&machine=standardLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=WestUs2)

#### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
1. Open the project:
    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-search-openai-demo)
1. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Now you can follow the instructions in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) below

### FAQ

<details><a id="compare-samples"></a>
<summary>How does this sample compare to other Chat with Your Data samples?</summary>

Another popular repository for this use case is here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT/

That repository is designed for use by customers using Azure OpenAI studio and Azure Portal for setup. It also includes `azd` support for folks who want to deploy it completely from scratch.

The primary differences:

* This repository includes multiple RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches that chain the results of multiple API calls (to Azure OpenAI and ACS) together in different ways. The other repository uses only the built-in data sources option for the ChatCompletions API, which uses a RAG approach on the specified ACS index. That should work for most uses, but if you needed more flexibility, this sample may be a better option.
* This repository is also a bit more experimental in other ways, since it's not tied to the Azure OpenAI Studio like the other repository.

<details><a id="switch-gpt4"></a>
<summary>How do you use GPT-4 with this sample?</summary>

In `infra/main.bicep`, change `chatGptModelName` to 'gpt-4' instead of 'gpt-35-turbo'. You may also need to adjust the capacity above that line depending on how much TPM your account is allowed.
</details>

<details><a id="azd-up-explanation"></a>
<summary>What does the `azd up` command do?</summary>

The `azd up` command comes from the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview), and takes care of both provisioning the Azure resources and deploying code to the selected Azure hosts.

The `azd up` command uses the `azure.yaml` file combined with the infrastructure-as-code `.bicep` files in the `infra/` folder. The `azure.yaml` file for this project declares several "hooks" for the prepackage step and postprovision steps. The `up` command first runs the `prepackage` hook which installs Node dependencies and builds the React.JS-based JavaScript files. It then packages all the code (both frontend and backend) into a zip file which it will deploy later.

Next, it provisions the resources based on `main.bicep` and `main.parameters.json`. At that point, since there is no default value for the OpenAI resource location, it asks you to pick a location from a short list of available regions. Then it will send requests to Azure to provision all the required resources. With everything provisioned, it runs the `postprovision` hook to process the local data and add it to an Azure Cognitive Search index.

Finally, it looks at `azure.yaml` to determine the Azure host (appservice, in this case) and uploads the zip to Azure App Service. The `azd up` command is now complete, but it may take another 5-10 minutes for the App Service app to be fully available and working, especially for the initial deploy.

Related commands are `azd provision` for just provisioning (if infra files change) and `azd deploy` for just deploying updated app code.

<details><a id="appservice-logs"></a>
<summary>How can we view logs from the App Service app?</summary>

You can view production logs in the Portal using either the Log stream or by downloading the default_docker.log file from Advanced tools.

The following line of code in `app/backend/app.py` configures the logging level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=os.getenv("APP_LOG_LEVEL", default_level))
```

To change the default level, either change `default_level` or set the `APP_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
to one of the [allowed log levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels):
`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

If you need to log in a route handler, use the the global variable `current_app`'s logger:

```python
async def chat():
    current_app.logger.info("Received /chat request")
```

Otherwise, use the `logging` module's root logger:

```python
logging.info("System message: %s", system_message)
```

If you're having troubles finding the logs in App Service, see this blog post on [tips for debugging App Service app deployments](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/06/tips-for-debugging-flask-deployments-to.html) or watch [this video about viewing App Service logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-aYuvws54).

### Troubleshooting

Here are the most common failure scenarios and solutions:

1. The subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) doesn't have access to the Azure OpenAI service. Please ensure `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` matches the ID specified in the [OpenAI access request process](https://aka.ms/oai/access).

1. You're attempting to create resources in regions not enabled for Azure OpenAI (e.g. East US 2 instead of East US), or where the model you're trying to use isn't enabled. See [this matrix of model availability](https://aka.ms/oai/models).

1. You've exceeded a quota, most often number of resources per region. See [this article on quotas and limits](https://aka.ms/oai/quotas).

1. You're getting "same resource name not allowed" conflicts. That's likely because you've run the sample multiple times and deleted the resources you've been creating each time, but are forgetting to purge them. Azure keeps resources for 48 hours unless you purge from soft delete. See [this article on purging resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/manage-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource).

1. You see `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when the `prepdocs.py` script runs. That's typically due to incorrect SSL certificates setup on your machine. Try the suggestions in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35569042/ssl-certificate-verify-failed-with-python3/43855394#43855394).

1. After running `azd up` and visiting the website, you see a '404 Not Found' in the browser. Wait 10 minutes and try again, as it might be still starting up. Then try running `azd deploy` and wait again. If you still encounter errors with the deployed app, consult these [tips for debugging App Service app deployments](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2023/06/tips-for-debugging-flask-deployments-to.html) or watch [this video about downloading App Service logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-aYuvws54). Please file an issue if the logs don't help you resolve the error.
